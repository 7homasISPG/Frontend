# Component Architecture Plan

## Current Analysis
The existing code is a single large `ChatInterface` component that handles:
- State management for messages, input, loading states
- UI rendering for both initial view and chat view
- API calls for sending messages and file uploads
- Multiple view types (table, answer, card selection)

## Proposed Component Structure

### 1. Main Container
- `App.js` - Main application wrapper
- `ChatInterface.js` - Main chat container (simplified)

### 2. Layout Components
- `InitialView.js` - Welcome screen with FAQ grid and suggestions
- `ChatView.js` - Chat conversation view
- `MessageList.js` - Container for all messages

### 3. Input Components
- `ChatInput.js` - Input field with attach button and send functionality
- `SuggestionChips.js` - Horizontal scrollable suggestion chips
- `FAQGrid.js` - Grid of frequently asked questions

### 4. Message Components
- `Message.js` - Individual message wrapper
- `UserMessage.js` - User message bubble
- `AssistantMessage.js` - Assistant message with avatar
- `SystemMessage.js` - System notifications

### 5. Content View Components (existing)
- `TableView.js` - Table data display
- `AnswerView.js` - Answer with citations and follow-ups
- `CardSelectionView.js` - Card selection interface

### 6. Utility Components
- `LoadingIndicator.js` - Loading spinner for messages
- `FileUpload.js` - File upload handling

## State Management
- Keep main state in `ChatInterface.js`
- Pass down props and callbacks to child components
- Use React hooks for local component state where needed

## Styling Approach
- Use Material-UI components as base
- Custom styling to match the clean, modern design from the image
- Consistent spacing, typography, and color scheme
- Smooth animations and transitions

## Key Design Elements from Image
- Clean white background
- Centered layout with max-width container
- Rounded input field with attach button and microphone icon
- Suggestion chips with icons
- FAQ cards in responsive grid
- Subtle shadows and borders
- Professional typography hierarchy
